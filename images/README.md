# Profile Photo

Replace the placeholder `profile.jpg` file with your own professional photo.

## Requirements

- **Format**: JPG or PNG
- **Recommended size**: 300x300 pixels (minimum)
- **Shape**: Square (will be displayed as a circle)
- **File name**: `profile.jpg` or `profile.png`

## Instructions

1. Add your professional headshot to this directory
2. Name it `profile.jpg` (or update the path in `_config.yml` if using a different name)
3. The photo will automatically appear in the sidebar with a circular crop

## Temporary Placeholder

Until you add your photo, the sidebar will show a broken image icon. This is normal and will be fixed once you upload your photo.
